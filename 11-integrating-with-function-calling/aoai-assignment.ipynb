    "For this lesson, we want to build a feature for our education startup that allows users to use a chatbot to find technical courses. We will recommend courses that fit their skill level, current role and technology of interest. \n",

    "To complete this we will use a combination of: \n",
    " - `Azure Open AI` to create a chat experience for the user\n",
    " - `Microsoft Learn Catalog API` to help users find courses based on the request of the user \n",
    " - `Function Calling` to take the user's query and send it to a function to make the API request. \n",

    "### Why Function Calling \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have completed any other lesson in this course, you probably understand the power of using Large Language Models (LLMs). Hopefully you can also see some of their limitations as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Function Calling is a feature of the Azure Open AI Service to overcome to the following limitations: \n",
    "1) Consistent response format \n",
    "2) Ability to use data from other sources of an application in a chat context \n",
    "\n",
    "Before function calling, responses from an LLM were unstructured and inconsistent.  Developers were required to write complex validation code to make sure they are able to handle each variation of a response. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users could not get answers like \"What is the current weather in Stockholm?\". This is because  models were limited to the time the data was trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the example below that illustrates this problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to create a database of student data so we can suggest the right course to them. Below we have two descriptions of students that are very similar in the data they contain."
